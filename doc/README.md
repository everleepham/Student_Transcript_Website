This project aims to create a student transcript system using Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I have made a deliberate choice not to utilize frameworks such as Flask, Django, Tornado, etc for this project. Instead, I have solely relied on Python.

To provide an overview of my website, I will include some images:

![image 1](./img%201.png)
In this image, all elements in the **Overall Active Population** list are clickable, enabling users to access the **Population** page for each group.


![image 2](./img%202.png)
The **Population** page consists of two sections: **Students** and **Courses**. The **Students** section contains two tables, one for Fall intake students and one for Spring intake students. Each student's email is clickable, allowing users to access the **Grade** page.

The **Grade** page allows users to view the transcript of each student, detailing every subject in their program.

Each items in the **Course** table are also clikable, allowing users to view the grades of every student in each course.

On every page, the **Welcome** link at the top is clickable and enables users to return to the **Welcome page**.
